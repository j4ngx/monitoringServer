# Server Monitoring

The function of the script is the creation of a telegram bot for monitoring a Linux server and later its administration. For this, the python library **[telegram](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/tree/master/tests)** has been used, together with the **[os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)** library to be able to execute the commands.
